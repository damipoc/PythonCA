"""
This exercise stub and the test suite contain several enumerated constants.

For this challenge, enumerated constants are written as a NAME assigned to an 
arbitrary, but unique value. An integer is traditionally used because itâ€™s memory
efficient.
It is a common practice to export both constants and functions that work with
those constants (ex. the constants in the os, subprocess and re modules).
